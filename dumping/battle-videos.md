# Using Battle Videos to dump your data

Using Battle Videos you can check up to 6 Pokémon at the same time of which at least one needs to be battle ready (that means you won't be able to check 6 eggs at the same time). You also need to find someone who will battle you every time you want to check any Pokémon. As such this method is very inconvenient. The only situation when this method is recommended it to check a Pokémon that you may or may not soft-reset.

## Set Up

You will need to create a key for each battle video slot that you want to be able to view. A key will always be able to decrypt your own party, but it may or may not be able to decrypt your opponent's Pokémon at the same time. This depends on whether your opponent has followed the following steps as well during the creation of the key.

1. Progress in the game until you get the VS Recorder. You need it to save battle videos.
2. Make sure you have at least two Pokémon in your party.
3. Start a battle, enter exactly one Pokémon and forfeit.
4. When asked to save the battle video, say yes.
5. Close your 3DS, take out the SD card and put it into your computer.
6. Go to TODO
7. Copy the file to a folder of your choice and append `-1` to the name.
8. Now put your SD into your 3DS again.
9. Start a battle enter any Pokémon first and the one you used in step 3 second and forfeit.
10. When asked to save the battle video, say yes.
11. Close your 3DS, take out the SD card and put it into your computer.
12. Go to TODO
13. Copy the file to a folder of your choice and append `-2` to the name.
14. Now start KeySAVe and go to the Breaking tab.
15. Click on *File 1* and open the video from step 7.
16. Click on *File 2* and open the video from step 13.
17. You should now see a dialog that a key has been created, it will be saved automatically. If you get an error, you have not followed the instructions correctly, please start over.

Now that the boring part is over, let's get right to dumping your Pokémon.

## Dumping your Pokémon

1. Put the Pokémon that you want to check in your party.
