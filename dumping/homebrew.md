# Accessing your data using Homebrew

Using Homebrew you can access the decrypted save data of your game directly. Creating a key is not required.

Since the requirements for Homebrew are numerous and you have a lot of different option, this guide will not tell you how to get Homebrew. Instead I recommend you check out the [Plailect's guide](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/Part-1-(Homebrew)). While it covers a lot of things beyond getting Homebrew, feel free to just not read the other parts at all. Once you have access to Homebrew, you can dump your saves using [svdt](https://github.com/meladroit/svdt/releases) and open them in KeySAVe.

You can also extract decrypted save data using SaveDataFiler if you are running a CFW or if you are using a Cybersaves device.

I have plans for other checking methods involving Homebrew that unfortunately I cannot work on currently as my 3DS is broken.
