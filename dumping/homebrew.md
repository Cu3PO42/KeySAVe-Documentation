# Accessing your data using Homebrew

Using Homebrew you can access the decrypted save data of your game directly. Creating a key is not required.

Since the requirements for Homebrew are numerous and you have a lot of different option, this guide will not get into details of how to get Homebrew. Instead I recommend you go to [Smea's website](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/) (at the time of writing you can click on webbrowser for a free entrypoint, however I also recommend you proceed to install menuhax after that) or check out the [Plailect's guide](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/Part-1-(Homebrew)). The latter covers a lot of things beyond getting Homebrew, feel free to just not read the other parts at all. Once you have access to Homebrew, you can dump your saves using [svdt](https://github.com/meladroit/svdt/releases) and open them in KeySAVᵉ. Please make sure never to save any data in the KeySAVᵉ folder itself.

You can also extract decrypted save data using SaveDataFiler if you are running a CFW or if you are using a Cybersaves device.
