# Accessing your data using Homebrew

Using Homebrew you can access the decrypted save data of your game directly. Creating a key is not required.

Since the requirements for Homebrew are numerous and you have a lot of different option, this guide will not tell you how to get Homebrew. Instead I recommend you check out the [/r/3dshacks subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/3dshacks). At the time of writing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/3dshacks/comments/4eh6sy/3dshacking_qa_general_silence_you_furry_fool/) is their latest guide. Once you have access to Homebrew, you can dump your saves using [svdt](https://github.com/meladroit/svdt/releases) and open them in KeySAVe.

You can also extract decrypted save data using SaveDataFiler if you are running a CFW or if you are using a Cybersaves device.

I have plans for other checking methods that unfortunately I cannot work on currently as my 3DS broke.
