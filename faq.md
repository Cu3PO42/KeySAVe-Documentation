# FAQ

This section will be expanded as questions are asked:

## Some slots don't show up properly for me. What can I do?

When you initially create keys, KeySAVe doesn't know how to decrypt all slots yet. For more info read [this](dumping/saves.md#ghosts).

## KeySAVe shows Pok√©mon that aren't actually in the save!

That can sometimes happen when your key is not yet complete and is a direct consequence of how the decryption works. For more info read [this](dumping/saves.md#ghosts).
