# The Reddit formatting plugin

The Reddit formatting plugin renders your Pok√©mon in tables as they would be displayed on [/r/svexchange](https://reddit.com/r/svexchange). They can either be split into boxes or displayed as one big table. [Ghosts](../dumping/saves.md#ghosts) may be shown, hidden or marked. Optionally the tables can be colored, they include the following info:

  * Species
  * Gender
  * Nature
  * Ability
  * IVs
  * Hidden Power
  * ESV

The appropriate Markdown will be generated to use them on the subreddit. Use the 'copy to clipboard' or 'save to file' button to access it.
