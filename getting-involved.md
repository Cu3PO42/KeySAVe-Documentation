# Getting involved

KeySAVᵉ is an open-source project and you can get involved in many different ways.

## Giving feedback

Did you encounter a bug? Is something not working as you'd expect it to? Do you think something could be better than it is currently? Need a new feature? Or do you just want to say hi?

In any case, you can [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Cu3PO42/KeySAVe/issues/new) write me an [e-mail](mailto:cu3po42@gmail.com), contact me on Twitter ([@Cu3PO42](https://twitter.com/Cu3PO42)), send me a PM on Reddit ([/u/Cu3PO42](https://reddit.com/u/Cu3PO42)) or join us at [#KeySAVe](irc://irc.synirc.net:6667/#KeySAVe) on synIRC. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!

A few things that are planned already:

* Improve the design. It doesn't look half-bad as it is now in my opinion, but I'm probably slaughtering Google's Material Design guidelines.
* Make the breaking process easier by having KeySAVᵉ do some extra things for you.
* Making the theme adjustable. I might make the theme fully customizable or just offer a light and a dark version.
* More checking methods. I have some ideas for checking methods based on Homebrew, but don't currently have a 3DS since mine broke.
* Lots of optimizations.

## Contributing

KeySAVᵉ itself is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cu3PO42/KeySAVe), feel free to fork it and send me some Pull Requests! The decryption part is a separate project called [KeySAVCoreJS](https://github.com/Cu3PO42/KeySAVCoreJS). If you just want to help me out a bit, it would be most appreciated if you gave the project a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cu3PO42/KeySAVe)!

If you want to help any other way, just let me know and we'll figure something out!

I still need/want a new icon that scales better across resolutions, so if you're interested in helping with that, please do let me know!
