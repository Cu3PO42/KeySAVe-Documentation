# Getting Started

First of you will want to grab the latest version of KeySAVᵉ from [GitHub](https://github.com/Cu3PO42/KeySAVᵉ/releases). A couple of notes on that:

  * `-darwin-` is the release you want if you're on Mac OS X. The reason for this is that OS X's kernel is called Darwin!
  * There is no release specifically for Windows 64-bit, but the 32-bit version will work just fine!
  * Unfortunately there is no 32-bit Linux version at this time, since I don't know of a CI server that does 32-bit Linux builds, if you know one, please [let me know]()! In the mean time, you'll just have to build it for yourself. Instructions can be found in the [README]().

Now that you have your release, go ahead and extract it to the folder of your choice. You can start KeySAVᵉ by double clicking the application on Mac, `KeySAVᵉ.exe` on Windows and starting the binary `KeySAVᵉ` on Linux (you may be required to mark it as executable if you can't start it right away.)

Now let's get some data extracted from your game. Go to the [Dumping](dumping.md) page for an overview of the methods that are available.  
If you currently use KeySAV2, check out the [migration guide](migration.md).
